Rock, Paper, Scissors 🎮

This is a simple Python game where you play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer.
The program includes different game modes, keeps score, and lets you exit any time.

This was one of my beginner Python projects, and it helped me practice functions, loops, user input, and basic program structure.

Game Modes

🔹 Endless Mode
Play as many rounds as you want. Type "quit" during a round to stop.
The game keeps track of your wins, losses, and ties.

🔹 Best of 3
First to 2 wins takes the match.

🔹 Best of 5

During each round:

You pick rock, paper, scissors (or quit)

The computer randomly picks its move

Scores are updated and displayed
